# VELoop Rewards — Wallet & Withdrawal Backend System

A backend-focused wallet and payout system built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, with a React frontend for demonstration.

The system is designed around backend-controlled wallet balances, an immutable transaction ledger, atomic wallet operations, withdrawal lifecycle management, idempotency protection, role-based administration, audit logging, and wallet reconciliation.

---

## 1. Project Overview

VELoop Rewards manages multiple wallet currencies and allows users to exchange eligible VE balances for configured payout options.

The backend is the source of truth for:

- Wallet balances
- Payout requirements
- Payout values
- Withdrawal eligibility
- Withdrawal status
- Wallet deductions and reversals
- Transaction history
- Administrative wallet adjustments

The frontend only requests and displays data. It does not determine or directly modify wallet balances.

---

## 2. Core Features

### User Authentication

- User registration
- User login
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing
- Account status validation
- Role-based access control

### Wallet

The wallet supports:

- VE
- SVE
- GEM
- TOKEN
- SPIN

Wallet-changing operations are performed by the backend.

### Wallet Ledger

Every wallet mutation creates a corresponding ledger transaction containing information such as:

- Transaction ID
- User ID
- Wallet ID
- Currency
- Direction
- Transaction type
- Amount
- Balance before
- Balance after
- Source
- Reference ID
- Status
- Description
- Metadata
- Timestamp

### Withdrawals

- Backend-controlled payout options
- Payout detail validation
- Balance validation
- Atomic wallet deduction
- Withdrawal creation
- Withdrawal status management
- Idempotency protection
- Rejection reversal
- Cancellation reversal
- Admin review

### Administration

Admin users can:

      Mongoose Models   Business Rules
          |
          v

```

The backend follows a layered structure:

```text
Routes
  ↓
Middleware
  ↓
Controllers
  ↓
Services
  ↓
Models
  ↓
MongoDB
```

Business-critical wallet and withdrawal logic is kept in the service layer rather than being controlled by the frontend.

The exact repository structure may vary slightly as the project evolves.

## 6. Wallet Design

A wallet document stores the current balance for each supported currency.

```text
Wallet
├── userId
├── ves
├── sves
├── gems
├── tokens
└── spins
```

The wallet balance is not trusted from the client.

For example, a client cannot safely submit:

```json
{
  "ves": 100000
}
```

and cause the backend to accept that value.

All balance changes are calculated and executed by backend services.

---

## 7. Ledger Design

The wallet uses a ledger-based accounting approach.

For a credit:

```text
balanceAfter = balanceBefore + amount
```

For a debit:

```text
balanceAfter = balanceBefore - amount
```

Each mutation records both the previous and resulting balance.

Example:

```text
Transaction
--------------------------------
Currency: VE
Direction: DEBIT
Amount: 2400
Balance Before: 5400
Balance After: 3000
Type: WITHDRAWAL
```

This provides an auditable history of wallet mutations.

The current wallet balance can also be compared against ledger-derived balances during reconciliation.

---

## 8. Withdrawal Design

The withdrawal process is backend controlled.

```text
Client
  |
  v
GET /withdrawals/payout-options
  |
  v
Select payout option
  |
  v
POST /withdrawals
  |
  v
Validate request
  |
  v
Validate payout option/details
  |
  v
Check wallet balance
  |
  v
Atomic wallet debit
  |
  v
Create withdrawal
  |
  v
Create ledger transaction
  |
  v
Create audit log
  |
  v
PENDING
  |
  v
Admin review
  |
  +--------------------+
  |                    |
  v                    v
APPROVED          REJECTED/CANCELLED
                       |
                       v
              WITHDRAWAL_REVERSAL
                       |
                       v
              Restore wallet balance
```

The wallet is deducted when the withdrawal is created.

If the withdrawal is subsequently rejected or cancelled, a compensating reversal transaction restores the deducted amount.

---

## 9. Payout Configuration

Payout requirements are stored in the database and returned by the backend.

Example:

```text
UPI_10
Required VE: 2400
Payout: ₹10

UPI_25
Required VE: 5800
Payout: ₹25
```

The frontend does not define these values.

This prevents a client from changing:

```text
requiredAmount
payoutAmount
payoutCurrency
```

to manipulate the withdrawal calculation.

---

## 10. Idempotency

Withdrawal creation accepts an `Idempotency-Key` header.

Example:

```http
Idempotency-Key: postman-withdrawal-001
```

If the same request is submitted again using the same key for the same user, the system prevents duplicate withdrawal processing.

This protects against:

- Double-clicks
- Client retries
- Network retries
- Duplicate API submissions

The intended result is one logical withdrawal rather than multiple wallet deductions.

---

## 11. Atomicity and Concurrency

Wallet mutations are treated as critical financial operations.

The system uses:

- Atomic wallet updates
- Conditional balance checks
- MongoDB transactions
- Ledger creation within the transaction
- Withdrawal creation within the transaction
- Audit creation within the transaction where applicable

The objective is to prevent situations such as:

```text
Request A → checks balance
Request B → checks same balance
Request A → debits
Request B → debits
```

without appropriate concurrency protection.

A withdrawal should only succeed if the required balance can be safely deducted.

---

## 12. Withdrawal Status Lifecycle

Supported statuses:

```text
PENDING
PROCESSING
APPROVED
REJECTED
CANCELLED
```

Typical lifecycle:

```text
PENDING → PROCESSING → APPROVED
```

Other supported outcomes include rejection and cancellation according to the implemented status transition rules.

Terminal states are not allowed to transition into unrelated later states.

For example, an approved withdrawal cannot simply be changed back to rejected.

---

## 13. Reversal Accounting

Because VE is deducted when the withdrawal is created, rejection or cancellation requires a compensating credit.

Example:

```text
Initial balance
2400 VE

Withdrawal created
-2400 VE

Balance
0 VE

Withdrawal rejected

Reversal
+2400 VE

Final balance
2400 VE
```

The reversal is represented as a separate ledger transaction:

```text
Type: WITHDRAWAL_REVERSAL
Direction: CREDIT
```

The original withdrawal debit is not deleted or modified to pretend that it never happened.

---

## 14. Reconciliation

Reconciliation compares the current wallet balance with the balance calculated from the ledger.

Conceptually:

```text
Expected Balance
=
Initial Balance
+ Credits
- Debits
± Adjustments
```

A reconciliation process can identify:

```text
Wallet Balance
       vs
Ledger Calculated Balance
```

A mismatch indicates that the stored wallet balance and transaction history are not consistent and requires investigation.

---

## 15. Database Models

The backend uses models for:

```text
User
Wallet
WalletTransaction
Withdrawal
PayoutOption
AuditLog
```

### User

Responsible for:

- Identity
- Email
- Password hash
- Role
- Account status
- Wallet reference
- Login metadata

### Wallet

Responsible for:

- User association
- Current balances

### WalletTransaction

Responsible for:

- Immutable wallet ledger records
- Balance before/after
- Transaction type
- Direction
- Currency
- References

### Withdrawal

Responsible for:

- Withdrawal request
- User and wallet association
- Payout option
- Payout details
- Amount
- Status
- Review information
- Idempotency key
- Related transaction

### PayoutOption

Responsible for:

- Backend-controlled payout configuration
- Required VE
- Payout amount
- Payout currency
- Method
- Active status

### AuditLog

Responsible for recording administrative and important wallet/withdrawal actions.

Examples include:

```text

GET /api/wallet/transactions
```

### Withdrawals

```text
GET  /api/withdrawals/payout-options

POST /api/admin/wallet/debit
```

### Reconciliation

```text
GET /api/admin/reconciliation/:userId
```

Full API documentation is available in:

```text
docs/API.md
```

---

## 17. Security Model

### Authentication

JWT authentication is used for protected endpoints.

### Authorization

Admin routes require:

```text
Authenticated User
        +
ADMIN Role
```

A normal user must not be able to perform administrative wallet or withdrawal actions.

### Ownership

User-facing wallet and withdrawal endpoints operate within the authenticated user's scope.

### Validation

Inputs such as:

- Email
- Password
- Amount
- Currency
- Payout option
- Payout details
- Pagination parameters

are validated before processing.

### NoSQL Injection Protection

MongoDB query input is sanitized to reduce NoSQL injection risks.

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is applied to sensitive endpoints such as authentication, withdrawal creation, and administrative wallet operations.

### Secrets

Sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables.

The real `.env` file must not be committed to Git.

---

## 18. Error Handling

The API uses a consistent error format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Error description"
  }
}
```

Common application errors include:

```text
INVALID_REQUEST
UNAUTHORIZED
FORBIDDEN
NOT_FOUND
INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE
INVALID_PAYOUT_DETAILS
INVALID_WITHDRAWAL_STATUS
DUPLICATE_REQUEST
INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
```

---

## 19. HTTP Status Codes

```text
200 OK
201 Created
400 Bad Request
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
409 Conflict
429 Too Many Requests
500 Internal Server Error
```

---

## 20. Postman

The project includes a Postman collection covering the primary API surface.

Recommended structure:

```text

```

---

## 26. Scaling Considerations

The current implementation is designed to demonstrate the core correctness and safety requirements of a wallet system.

For larger production workloads, additional infrastructure could include:

### Database

- Proper compound indexes
- Query optimization
- MongoDB replica sets
- Database monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery

### Asynchronous Processing

Long-running payout processing could be moved to background workers or queues.

```text
API
 ↓
Withdrawal Created
 ↓
Queue
 ↓
Worker
 ↓
Payout Provider
 ↓
Status Update
```

### Caching

Read-heavy data such as active payout options could be cached where appropriate.

### Rate Limiting

Rate limits can be distributed across application instances using shared infrastructure.

### Fraud Detection

Additional controls could include:

- Velocity checks
- Withdrawal limits
- Account risk scoring
- Device/IP analysis
- Suspicious activity detection

### Observability

A production deployment should include:

- Structured logging
- Metrics
- Distributed tracing
- Error monitoring
- Alerts
- Transaction monitoring

### Reconciliation

Scheduled reconciliation jobs can detect accounting inconsistencies automatically.

---

## 27. Design Principles

The system follows several important principles:

### Backend Is the Source of Truth

The client cannot determine:

- Wallet balances
- Required VE
- Payout amounts
- Withdrawal status
- Eligibility

### Ledger Is Append-Oriented

Wallet mutations create transaction records instead of silently changing historical records.

### Financial Operations Are Atomic

Wallet deduction and related records are coordinated using database transactions.

### Duplicate Requests Are Controlled

Idempotency prevents repeated requests from creating multiple logical withdrawals.

### Administrative Actions Are Auditable

Important admin actions create audit records.

### User Data Is Scoped

Users access their own wallet and withdrawal data through authenticated context.

---

## 28. Known Project Scope

This project demonstrates the wallet, ledger, withdrawal, administration, security, and reconciliation architecture required for the assignment.

Actual external payout settlement is outside the demonstrated backend flow unless a real payout provider is separately integrated.

The frontend is a demonstration client. Financial and business rules remain in the backend.

---

## 29. Documentation

Project documentation should include:

```text
README.md
docs/API.md
docs/DATABASE.md
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
VELoop_Rewards_API.postman_collection.json
```

These documents describe the implementation, API surface, database design, architecture, and API testing workflow.
