# 4. Withdrawal Status

Supported statuses:

- `PENDING`
- `PROCESSING`
- `APPROVED`
- `REJECTED`
- `CANCELLED`

Typical lifecycle:

```text
PENDING
   ↓
PROCESSING
   ↓
APPROVED
```

A withdrawal can also be rejected or cancelled according to the supported status transitions.

When a withdrawal is rejected or cancelled after the wallet has already been debited, the system creates a compensating:

```text
WITHDRAWAL_REVERSAL
```

ledger transaction to restore the wallet balance.

---

# 5. Admin APIs

Admin authentication and `ADMIN` authorization are required.

## View Withdrawals

**GET** `/admin/withdrawals`

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `page` | Page number | `1` |
| `limit` | Records per page; maximum `100` | `20` |
| `status` | `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `CANCELLED` | — |

### Example

```http
GET /admin/withdrawals?status=PENDING&page=1&limit=20
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "withdrawals": [],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20,
      "total": 0,
      "totalPages": 0
    }
  }
}
```

**Status:** `200 OK`

## Approve Withdrawal

**POST** `/admin/withdrawals/:withdrawalId/approve`

### Request Body

Optional:

```json
{
  "reviewNote": "Withdrawal approved"
}
```

### Result

Changes an eligible withdrawal to:

```text
APPROVED
```

The wallet is not debited again because the VE deduction occurs when the withdrawal is created.

## Reject Withdrawal

**POST** `/admin/withdrawals/:withdrawalId/reject`

### Request Body

```json
{
  "rejectionReason": "Invalid payout details",
  "reviewNote": "Rejected after review"
}
```

### Result

Changes an eligible withdrawal to:

```text
REJECTED
```

If VE was already deducted, a `WITHDRAWAL_REVERSAL` transaction restores the deducted amount.

## Cancel Withdrawal

**POST** `/admin/withdrawals/:withdrawalId/cancel`

### Request Body

Optional:

```json
{
  "reviewNote": "Cancelled during review"
}
```

### Result

Changes an eligible withdrawal to:

```text
CANCELLED
```

If VE was already deducted, a `WITHDRAWAL_REVERSAL` transaction restores the deducted amount.

## Admin Wallet Credit

**POST** `/admin/wallet/credit`

### Request Body

```json
{
  "userId": "<USER_ID>",
  "currency": "VE",
  "amount": 500,
  "description": "Admin reward adjustment"
}
```

### Successful Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "wallet": {},
    "transaction": {}
  }
}
```

The operation creates an `ADMIN_CREDIT` ledger transaction and an audit record.

## Admin Wallet Debit

**POST** `/admin/wallet/debit`

### Request Body

```json
{
  "userId": "<USER_ID>",
  "currency": "VE",
  "amount": 500,
  "description": "Admin balance adjustment"
}
```

### Successful Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "wallet": {},
    "transaction": {}
  }
}
```

The operation creates an `ADMIN_DEBIT` ledger transaction and an audit record.

## Reconciliation

**GET** `/admin/reconciliation/:userId`

### Authentication

Admin authentication required.

### Description

Compares the user's current wallet balances against the calculated balances from the wallet ledger and reports reconciliation results.

---

# 6. Security

The API implements:

- JWT authentication
- Role-based admin authorization
- User ownership checks
- Request validation
- NoSQL injection sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Idempotency protection
- Atomic wallet updates
- MongoDB transactions
- Audit logging

Protected APIs obtain the authenticated user from the authentication context rather than trusting an arbitrary client-supplied user identity.

---

# 7. Important Wallet Rules

The wallet balance is never trusted from the frontend.

All balance-changing operations are performed by the backend.

Every wallet mutation produces a corresponding ledger transaction.

Wallet operations use atomic updates and database transactions to protect balances during concurrent operations.

---

# 9. HTTP Status Codes

| Status | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `200` | Request completed successfully |
| `201` | Resource created successfully |
| `400` | Invalid request or validation/business-rule failure |
| `401` | Authentication missing or invalid |
| `403` | Authenticated user does not have required permission |
| `404` | Requested resource not found |
| `409` | Duplicate or conflicting operation |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Unexpected server-side error |

---

# 10. Error Response

Standard error format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Error description"
  }
}
```

Examples of application-level error codes include:

```text
INVALID_REQUEST
UNAUTHORIZED
FORBIDDEN
NOT_FOUND
INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE
INVALID_PAYOUT_DETAILS
INVALID_WITHDRAWAL_STATUS
DUPLICATE_REQUEST
INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
```

The exact error code depends on the validation or service failure.

# 11. API Request Authentication Summary

| API Group | Authentication | Admin Role |
|---|---|---|
| `/auth/*` | Not required | No |
| `/wallet/*` | Required | No |
| `/withdrawals/*` | Required | No |
| `/admin/withdrawals/*` | Required | Yes |
| `/admin/wallet/*` | Required | Yes |
| `/admin/reconciliation/*` | Required | Yes |

---

# 12. Wallet Currencies

The wallet supports five backend-controlled currencies:

| Code | Wallet Field |
|---|---|
| `VE` | `ves` |
| `SVE` | `sves` |
| `GEM` | `gems` |
| `TOKEN` | `tokens` |
| `SPIN` | `spins` |

Wallet balances are maintained by the backend and represented in the wallet ledger.

---

# 13. Ledger and Accounting

Every wallet balance mutation is represented by a wallet transaction.

A ledger transaction records information such as:

- Transaction ID
- User ID
- Wallet ID
- Currency
- Direction
- Transaction type
- Amount
- Balance before
- Balance after
- Source
- Reference ID
- Status
- Description
- Metadata
- Timestamp

For a normal debit:

```text
balanceAfter = balanceBefore - amount
```

For a normal credit:

```text
balanceAfter = balanceBefore + amount
```

For a rejected or cancelled withdrawal, the compensating reversal restores the previously deducted amount.

---

# 14. Postman Collection

The project includes a Postman collection covering the implemented API surface.

Recommended collection structure:

```text
VELoop Rewards API
├── Auth
│   ├── Register User
│   └── Login User
├── Wallet
│   ├── Get Wallet
│   ├── Get Wallet Summary
│   └── Get Transactions
├── Withdrawals
│   ├── Get Payout Options
│   ├── Create Withdrawal
│   ├── Get Withdrawals
│   └── Get Withdrawal
├── Admin - Withdrawals
│   ├── List Withdrawals
│   ├── Approve Withdrawal
│   ├── Reject Withdrawal
│   └── Cancel Withdrawal
├── Admin - Wallet
│   ├── Credit Wallet
│   └── Debit Wallet
└── Admin - Reconciliation
    └── Reconcile Wallet
```

Collection variable:

```text
baseUrl = http://localhost:5000/api
```

For authenticated requests, use the JWT returned by the login endpoint.

---

# 15. API Testing Scope

The implemented API was tested through Postman for the primary wallet and withdrawal flows, including:

- User registration
- User login
- Wallet retrieval
- Wallet summary
- Wallet transaction history
- Payout option retrieval
- Withdrawal creation
- Withdrawal idempotency
- Withdrawal history
- Individual withdrawal retrieval
- Admin withdrawal listing
- Admin approval
- Admin rejection
- Admin cancellation
- Admin wallet credit
- Admin wallet debit
- Admin authorization
- Wallet reconciliation

Additional negative/security tests may be documented separately according to the tests actually executed.

---

# 16. Local Development

```bash
npm install
```
